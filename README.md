# JavaScript DApp Template

This is a template for JavaScript Cartesi DApps. It uses node to execute the backend application.
The application entrypoint is the `src/index.js` file. It is bundled with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io), but any bundler can be used.

# Random Password Generator DApp

This is a decentralized application (dApp) that generates random passwords using the Cartesi Rollups framework. The dApp takes user input (strings) and generates an 8 to 12 character randomized password. The dApp also provides API endpoints to inspect the generated passwords and the total count of passwords generated.
